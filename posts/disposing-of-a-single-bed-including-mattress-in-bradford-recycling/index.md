At first I offered on facebook/blog if anyone wanted it. Turns out that was a big fat fail.

So I took it to the skip, expecting a "mattress" recycling area specifically for mattresses.

Turns out that such a thing doesn't exist. Mattress' just go into the general waste skip.

So if your environmentally conscious you may want to research into mattress recycling before expecting your local council to do your homework for you.
