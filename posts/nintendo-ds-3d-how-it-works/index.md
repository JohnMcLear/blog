Jeff did a great video explaining how the 3DS works. Useful info for any of the folks using Nintendo DS' in the classroom at current.

Word on the street is that the 3DS is absolutely amazing. One thing to take into account is that with 3D you naturally get a lesser viewing angle so **group work on one device won't be possible**!

I'm not a fan of nintendo technology but I'm getting one of these to see what I can hack onto it!
