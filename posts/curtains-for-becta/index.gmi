Well our old friend is gone.  I'm going to be lost without being able to say "this is what Becta recommend".  I guess it will open up more choice and creativity inside of ICT but I fear it will lead to uncertainty and extra for work for ICT bods trying to figure out best practice.  I'm lucky because I have an army of educators on my twitter[2] network.  I also think Primary Technology[3] may benefit from a slightly more fragmented decision making process inside authorities and nationwide.

Still, sorry to anyone who reads this that is out of work.
