Want to host PrimaryWall in your school for your pupils/teachers and/or customize the look & feel? Good news! We open sourced the project so you can go ahead and [download it now](https://github.com/Pita/primarywall/zipball/master)!

We open soured PrimaryWall as part of our ongoing commitment to Open source software and community engagement/control over technology. We will still be providing [PrimaryWall.com](http://primarywall.com) as that is where we will be developing new features.
