You can test your different Google Apps by accessing the below URLS (REPLACE yourdomain.com with the domain name you chose to use and set up):

[http://sites.yourdomain.com](http://sites.yourdomain.com/) – Your schools Google Sites

[http://docs.yourdomain.com](http://docs.yourdomain.com/) – Your schools Google Docs

By now you get the idea… You can also access your Google Apps (including the admin panel) at (REPLACE yourdomain.com with the domain name you chose to use and set up) [http://google.com/a/yourdomain.com](http://google.com/a/yourdomain.com)
