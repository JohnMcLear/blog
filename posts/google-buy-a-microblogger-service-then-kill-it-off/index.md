Finnish microblogging service Jaiku has been acquired by [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") ([NSDQ: GOOG](http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&Ticker=GOOG "GOOG")) for an undisclosed sum, according to an announcement on the company’s site. Like its main competitor [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/), Jaiku allows users to share short messages and presence alerts with each other, using either a computer or a mobile device. Oct 2007.

It does give to wonder why Google would want to buy the code from a Microblogger service though.
