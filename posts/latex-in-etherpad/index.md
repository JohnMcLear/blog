## What are these things?

[Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) is an open-source collaborative editor. [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) is a high-quality typesetting system

## Getting started with LaTeX and Etherpad

To install the plugin browse to `http://youretherpadhere/admin/plugins` and install the **ep\_mathjax** plugin

Once the plugin is installed click the ∏ button and you can begin writing LaTeX Markup. Submitting the form will insert the LaTeX representation of your text into the pad.
