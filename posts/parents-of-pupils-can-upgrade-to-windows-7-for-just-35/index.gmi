But Microsoft are up to their old tricks...

RT *@*studentsoftware[1]: Parents/Students: Get your pre-order in now for Win 7 Pro £35 offer, 32-bit or 64-bit editions: http://bit.ly/4EgNIk[2]

Reading that tweet makes it sound like you can buy Windows 7 for £35 right? Why include the 32/64 bit edition part and not the word upgrade? The tweet was RT'd by someone senior in Microsoft's marketing department.

I think Microsoft should learn that consumers don't like being mislead, especially those in the education market... This offer is still great and we salute them for taking pupils and teachers into account! Thanks Microsoft.
