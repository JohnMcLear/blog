Hi all, on Tuesday and Wednesday next week(25th and 26th of June) I'm doing a presentation aimed at Primary Schools who currently have and/or are thinking of getting wireless devices/networks installed. The agenda for the presentation is:

  

1.The wireless network

2.The wireless learner

3.Wireless security

4.Wireless life span

5.How much wireless coverage do I need?

6.Wireless costs

7.Additional Considerations IE storage.

8.Wireless safety

9.Questions

  

The event is being run by Education Bradford's Curriculum ICT team and details can be found here

  

Slides and a Webcast will be online shortly after (Probably by Thursday) - These will be available to everyone.

  

Tuesday: Greenhead CLC

Wednesday: [Challenge CLC](http://www.challengeclc.co.uk/)
