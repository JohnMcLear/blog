[Uruguay just give every primary school pupil a laptop](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8309583.stm). This was only possibly by kind donations of USB memory sticks to Sugar.

  

Sugar is the operating system that runs on the devices, it is bootable anywhere from a USB stick. The USB memory stick doesn't need to be large, 512 megabytes is plenty!

  

Please send your used USB memory sticks to http://recycleusb.com and they will turn them into Sugar sticks ready to be used by children all over the world!
