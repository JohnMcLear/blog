I went out today to test out some pocket sprung beds in comparison to silent nights miracoil system. I need a new bed for myself so I figured I should focus on something specific when chosing my matress.

The silent night system certainly presents a more cost effective solution but is it at the cost of comfort? In short.. Yes. I found the silent night beds far more comfortable, sturdy and suitable for my needs. They present a sleeping solution that is "harder" than the pocket sprung, by doing this you don't feel lost in the bed, you still feel in control but remain in a comfortable position.
