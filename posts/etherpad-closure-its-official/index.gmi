So folks Etherpad.com[1] is definatley closing, and only 2 weeks later than I predicted[2].  Do not fret though, Etherpad.org[3] (Run by the Open source Etherpad Foundation) has promised to have a good transition plan in place within the next 7 days and I will be helping with the process.  Etherpad isn't dead, if anything this is just the beginning :)

Obviously I recommend schools use Primary Pad[4] but I am biased.

Here is an extract from Aaron Iba's statement:

> * EtherPad service will remain the same until April 14th.
> * On April 14th, we will disable new pad creation, but you will still be able to access your existing pads.
> * On May 14th, we will shut down the service and replace the etherpad.com home page with links to other services.

As a reminder, here are two helpful ways to get your data off of EtherPad servers:

* For free public pads, you can export the pad data to various formats through the "Import/Export" tab at the top of the pad page.
* For Professional Edition pads, you can export pads individually or download a single ZIP file of all your pad data by clicking the "Download all pads" link at the bottom of the pad list.
