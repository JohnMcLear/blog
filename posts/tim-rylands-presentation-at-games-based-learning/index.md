Tim is a great presenter, sit back end enjoy.

Usually when we talk about [Games based learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_based_learning "Game based learning") we expect that children will be the consumers of the game, not the creators. With more creativity coming into the new [primary curriculum](http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/new-primary-curriculum/) it will be interesting to see how classrooms:

1. Become creative
2. Decide on a target audience for their creations
3. Publish their creativity
4. Get assessed on their creative outpu

I hope that within the next 5 years pupils will be making their own games of a high enough quality and engagement for us to share on [Primary Games Arena](http://primarygamesarena.com)
