Over the past few weeks I have been busy shipping 3000+ [NFC Rings](http://nfcring.com). I will continue to be busy until 1st of January.

Apologies if this means I have ignored you or not been able to communicate effectively / complete a task.

FWIW it's rare things like this happen so don't worry.

I should be back to work again as normal in January.
