The Yorkshire Tea and the Primary Technology[1] Sims support mugs have arrived and I thought it would be cool to show you the scale of the operation :o All of these mugs & tea bags going out to Bradford schools in 1st week of term to celebrate the launch of Primary Technology's sims support service and 6 years doing tech support!
