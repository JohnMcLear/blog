Syncplicity is a small client application that periodicly uploads files to the internet so you can access them from another location. Accounts are free, limited to GB. Accounts are per email address.

  

Installation and configuration is unbelievably easy so there are no technical barriers.

  

I'm backing up my "my documents" as if I was a pupil at home on a netbook.

  

I think if syncplicity allowed shibboleth based logon to this service then they could be onto a winner. A school which had no servers could use this to backup and save pupils work.

  

There are of course a few advantages of having servers and those should not be ignored. I'm also not so sure on Becta's stance on something like this, inevitably private information will be uploaded and the question has to be asked. Can simplicity be trusted any more or less than any other provider ie the remote backup services from Primary Technology? Primary Technology offer the same service but an annual charge of £200.

  

Visit [syncplicity](http://syncplicity.com/) to download and check it out, I'm going to leave it running on my computer over the next few months just to see how it goes.
