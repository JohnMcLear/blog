[1]One way to look at the success of an educational site is to look at the amount of time in a year spent by users on that site. Below is exactly that.

Total hours since Nov 2,2008:

School Email[2] = 7,806 hours
School Safe Search[3] = 1,894 hours
Primary Games Arena[4] = 1,154 hours
Primary Technology[5] = 771 hours
Primary Blogger[6] = 770 hours
Primary School Teaching[7] (Opened May 2009) = 408 hours
School Closures (Opened Sep 2009) = 84 hours
McLear[8](My Blog) = 63.7 hours

Thanks to google analytics[9] we can get this information.

I have being able to use this information to explain the real time importance of the sites to their teams. For example if I say to a coder the website has 400 visits a day it doesn't sound as impressive as if I say..

"The website gives 10 hours of educational help every single day..."

Primary School Teaching[10] has served 2+ hours worth of resources every day, for a website purely built by a community of educators I think our hats go off to teachers for being part of a sharing, web2 community.

Of course if your website is purely designed then a user will struggle to get to the resource they need, we know that isn't the case here - our users tend to come, find one thing then continue to browse around the site looking for useful resources. Are teachers and learners naturally inquisitive?
