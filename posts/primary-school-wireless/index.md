My Presentation on [Primary School Wireless](http://www.primaryt.co.uk/networks.html) that I did for [Bradford Curriculum ICT](http://www.bradfordschools.net/curriculumict/) is due soon. I dropped the hard disk off at [Challenge CLC](http://www.challengeclc.co.uk/) and I'm just waiting on getting the video footage back. It should only take me a few days to process the footage then I will release it on here/youtube.

  

If you have any questions before it goes live on the site then please email me or Dally@Primaryt.co.uk and we will be happy to help.

  

Here are our contact details for [wireless networks](http://www.primaryt.co.uk/networks.html)

  

Just been told the video is now on the hard disk so I will be picking it up tomorrow afternoon!

  

UPDATE: This is now available on [You tube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2A0Alfa5zw&feature=youtube_gdata)
