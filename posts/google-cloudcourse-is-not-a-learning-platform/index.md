 **[![](images/logo_1601.png "logo_160[1]")](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/logo_1601.png)**_"CloudCourse is a course scheduling system. " -- [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cloudcourse/)._

**Not a learning platform.  ([as claimed by this post](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/05/cloudcourse-enterprise-application-in.html))**

C'mon people, just because something is a web based tool that can be used WITHIN a learning platform doesn't mean it IS a learning platform.  Educators are already confused enough with companies offering them learning platforms that don't do what a learning platform should do according to Becta(RIP) and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment).

_Obviously a lot of people are still confused to what is a learning platform.  I recommend you watch [this video](https://mclear.co.uk/2010/05/25/what-is-a-learning-platform/)._

_**[There is a live version of cloudcourse for YOU TO PLAY WITH here.](https://primarycourse.appspot.com/)**_

It is pretty much irrelevant for Primary Schools, I will try to find a creative way to use it in a primary but don't hold your breath...

I am waiting on a call/email from Irwin(from the CloudCourse team) who will hopefully disagree with me and prove me wrong.

**Does Cloudcourse compete with Frog, Moodle & other learning platforms?  No.**
