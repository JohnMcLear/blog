I recently found myself owning a HTC One M8, all of the reviews looked great.  However I have a huge gripe with the metal body.  While this phone looks great metal bodies fail for these 3 reasons:

1, **Slippy.**  Because the phone body is metal and because the edges are far too rounded the phone slides out of your hand far too easily.  It's also way too big for an average sized hand but I kinda got used to this.

2\. **Cold to touch.**  Admittedly I'm probably one of a handful of people that lives in an old, cold house.  This phone just becomes a horrible thing to touch when it's been left out in a cold room over night when the heating is off.

3\. **NFC.**  The NFC support on this phone only really works where the camera lens is, this is probably mostly due to the metal body, I can imagine the discussion went something along the lines of..  Engineer: Yea but it will affect phone signal and NFC performance..  Sales guy: "Yea but SHINY!"...  We need to grow up and use the right materials, not just the ones that are the most ascetically pleasing.  A phone is not a piece of jewellery.

**Thankfully the Dot view case solves all 3 of these problems**.  It's disappointing but understandable that the LED output isn't visible in direct sunlight conditions.  The case also serves as a nice little stand keeping the phone tilted to you in landscape mode when placed flat on a surface.

I also wish this phone came with less bloat-ware, ugh!
