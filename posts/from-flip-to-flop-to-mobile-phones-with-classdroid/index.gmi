[1]Flip cameras are dead.. Yep. You read that right[2].. Cisco have killed the product/brand/company.. Why? Because everyone is using mobile phones to capture video and images.. So what choice do teachers have? How about a nice little app for android phones called Classdroid[3]? It's free and is written specifically for teachers.. G'wan.. Give it a go today, search for classdroid on your phone or install it via the market place.
