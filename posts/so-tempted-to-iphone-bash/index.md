Modifying etherpad source today and needed to change this line  

_"PrimaryPad is not yet fully-functional on the iPhone."_

So tempted to Change it to..  
  

_"PrimaryPad is not yet fully-functional on the iPhone. Ha!"_  
Or..  
  

_"PrimaryPad is not yet fully-functional on the iPhone. Looks like you don't fully respect open source!"_  
  

But of course Etherpad isn't fully-functional on the Android yet neither ;)
