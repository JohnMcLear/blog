[Show My Homework](http://showmyhomework.co.uk/) is a web based service for teachers to creates a calendar for pupils that shows when homework has been issued and is due.

The process works like this:

- Teacher posts a piece of homework, including information such as the recipient class and date/time.
- Pupil checks on a certain URL to see what homework has been assigned to their class.

This website is primarily aimed at secondary schools and colleges where homework is set in advance and is essential to the ongoing education of the child. Comparing this service to something like [Edmodo](http://www.edmodo.com "Edmodo") is difficult as Edmodo is much more of a communication platform where files are the focus.

I don't see the Primary School uptake of a system like this being high.  The concept is great and so is the delivery but I feel without a large change in the way primary schools assign homework and a change in the way the website handles individual/group assignments, learning platform integration that this service may be overlooked for some time to come.

The credit process encourages teachers to get other teachers involved with Show My Homework by providing free credits as a reward for inviting other teachers.  There is no mention about how the process will work when all of a schools teachers have been invited onto the system.  I expect this is when a small fee will come into place.

Show My Homework is focused more on classes than groups, some would argue this sacrifices individualized learning for a more formal work structure, this seems like a natural sacrifice as Show My Homework is a specific job for a specific task and that task is [homework assignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework "Homework").

I like Show My Homework for its simplicity and practicality and salute it for not trying to be something it isn't.  A perfect example of how it is beautifully simple are the email reminders, nudging you if you haven't assigned any homework lately.  I personally think Naimish and his team should think about providing an [open standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard") for homework assignment that can integrate with a learning platform such as [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org "Moodle").
