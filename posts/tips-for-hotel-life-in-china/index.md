I recently spent 3 weeks in hotels in China and realized I should share some insights and recommendations..

- The roads are noisy and distracting, **bring speakers/headphones/ear plugs**.

- It gets wet so **bring short socks / sandles**

- If you have a hotel pool, **bring a swimming hat**

- The Internet might be filtered, **preload maps and/or organize a VPN**

- Lots of beer is bottled, **bring a bottle opener**

Words worth remembering..

- Nee how - Hello

- Ching Dao - A brand of beer..

- Shey shey - Thank you

- Dong La - I understand

I'd recommend learning the Chinese way of saying your hotel name. Each hotel will have a business card with their address in both English and Chinese, **pick a handful of your hotels business cards up**..

I'd recommend learning the name of the KTV nearest to your hotel, these are usually used as great reference points.. KTV = Karaoke joint..
