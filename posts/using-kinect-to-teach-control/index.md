Let's face it, the "forward 3,left,forward 2" type of programming is dead.

How about Kinect watches you do something then programs a robot to do it by copying your movements?

The same logic applies, you are dictating how an electronic device interacts with a physical space but in a much more natural (human gestures) way.

Watch the video to get a better idea of what I'm trying to explain.

Oh and at the risk of supporting Microsoft (2 posts in a week, I know it's crazy.) [here is a reminder](http://cssferret.imgur.com/microsoft_wtf) that Microsoft still suck really bad from time to time (although they are getting better imho).
