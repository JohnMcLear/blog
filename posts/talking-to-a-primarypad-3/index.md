Inclusion and accessibility are right up on the agenda here at Primary Technology and today we have been able to tick a really big box by including Speech to Text support on Pads in PrimaryPad. Real time collaboration without a keyboard in this world with a penetration of mobile and tablet factor devices is a really nice feature and we’re really proud of our contributions to Etherpad Lite which have made this possible.

At current Speech to Text is only available in Google Chrome however over the next few months we expect to see other browsers adopting this fantastic input method! Enjoy!
