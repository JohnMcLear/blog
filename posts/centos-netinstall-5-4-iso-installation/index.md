Iv'e had to install CentOS 10+ times today and I wanted to quickly document my procedure:

  

1. Grab http://mirror.sov.uk.goscomb.net/centos/5.4/isos/i386/CentOS-5.4-i386-netinstall.iso & boot from it however you/I want.
2. Select HTTP install then for server type: **mirror.centos.org**
3. For path type: **centos/5.4/os/i386**

  

Go go gadget arms.
