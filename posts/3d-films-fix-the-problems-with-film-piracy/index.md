Lately Iv'e been thinking about piracy, this is a slightly hot topic as we have been dealing with Microsoft licensing a lot lately (for primary email and Bradford primary schools).  
  
We went to see monster vs aliens at the Imax(Bradford) in 3d and it was awesome.  
  
It is probably the most obvious fix to people pirating films that there is.  
  
If more films came out in 3d at the Imax I would definitely be there.
