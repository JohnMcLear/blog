**Not a learning platform.  (as claimed by this post[3])**

C'mon people, just because something is a web based tool that can be used WITHIN a learning platform doesn't mean it IS a learning platform.  Educators are already confused enough with companies offering them learning platforms that don't do what a learning platform should do according to Becta(RIP) and Wikipedia[4].

*Obviously a lot of people are still confused to what is a learning platform.  I recommend you watch this video[5].*

***There is a live version of cloudcourse for YOU TO PLAY WITH here.[6]***

It is pretty much irrelevant for Primary Schools, I will try to find a creative way to use it in a primary but don't hold your breath...

I am waiting on a call/email from Irwin(from the CloudCourse team) who will hopefully disagree with me and prove me wrong.

**Does Cloudcourse compete with Frog, Moodle & other learning platforms?  No.**
