Ever wanted to export your Primarywall note contents to Wordle? Now you can! When on a wall click Share -> Go!

Ever wanted to know how many times a certain word has been used on a wall? Now when you search for a word you get a word count. This is better than other systems as you can type part of a word and use that as a work around for spelling mistakes ![:)](http://blog.primaryt.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
