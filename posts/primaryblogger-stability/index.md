Primaryblogger’s stability should now be 100%.  The bug that we isolated was due to a rogue plugin and some compression being applied without our consent.  Apologies for the slightly rough 24 hours.  We have learned a lot while applying the required fix (rm stupidfilename.php) and we will be having some strong words with the developer.  

We feel it’s important to stress that we host over 2000 school blogs on PrimaryBlogger and we have a lot of complex technology in place to ensure we can offer the service free of charge.  PrimaryBlogger is far from being an “out of the box” or self hosted wordpress solution. Here is a video explaining a problem we had previously and a bit about the infrastrucure we have in place to deliver your blogs!
