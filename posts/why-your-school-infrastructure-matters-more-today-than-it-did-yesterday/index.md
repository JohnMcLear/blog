With the launch of [PrimaryWall](http://primarywall.com) we noticed that we have a number of schools getting periodic dropped connections, this is due to schools infrastructures "dropping packets".  I was dealing with a school a few months ago who had a technical support provider who promised them that dropping ~5% of packets wouldn't affect their performance..  This may of been true for their current usage but really-real time web apps such as PrimaryWall and PrimaryPad require that your infrastructure is correctly configured, any packet loss is a potential future failure and should be avoided.  So how can you see if your infrastructure is up to par?
