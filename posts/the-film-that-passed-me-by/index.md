I watched Terra for the first time the other day and it is a good film, way better than a lot of the other animated stuff. I'm guessing cause it wasn't made by pixar or any of the other big players in Hollywood that it kinda passed us by?

  

Was I in a bubble when this came out or did it never get any publicity?

  

Either way go buy it at amazon or download it, if you do download it then remember to buy some merchandise or something not that I'm justifying illegal downloads..

Get it in blu-ray if you're a TV geek, I watched it on standard DVD and it was great but I bet it is awesome in blu-ray!
