You don't need to do any custom css or xlst to provide a UI suitable for the Amazon Kindle web browser in Wordpress.

The simplest way is to:

1. Grab the [wptouch](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/) plugin
2. Goto the settings, find Custom user-agents
3. In the input box type Kindle then hit save.

Visit your Wordpress site from your Kindle and hit save.  Enjoy!
