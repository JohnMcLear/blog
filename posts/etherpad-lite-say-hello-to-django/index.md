@Sfyn [wrote a great write up about how he used Etherpad Lite with his recent thinkwemust.org project](http://www.riotnrrd.info/tech/etherpad-lite-performances-ongoing-saga) so we wanted to show him some love back by sharing his [django etherpad-lite app](https://github.com/sfyn/django-etherpad-lite) with the rest of the Etherpad Lite community.

Over the next few weeks we have even more announcement so stay tuned ![:)](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/418/files/2012/06/icon_smile.gif)
