Got my laptop out at the airport and swarms of people came around me to try to get updates for my flight. Turns out I was far more useful than the girls on the desk. Idea for a business, non biased, non liable information desk that is purely a peon charging £1 per person for information at times like this.

Unbelievable how bad the information flow is from the airlines to the desks. In Morroco the cues here are large, thankfully I'm with Easyjet[3] and not Ryanair[4].
