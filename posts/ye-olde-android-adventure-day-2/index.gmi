Today as I ventured towards Droidville I met a sage who reminded me about some useful keystokes.

Eclipse: Control Alt Down duplicates line Emulator: Rotate screen - Control F11

As I moved closer to Droidville the air began to fill with hope, thousands of hopeful children and teachers poored into the streets, so I quickly hid and jumped into Bar Youtube (Part of the Starbucks chain) and watched another video to further my understanding of the power of Android[1], another good one this time by Ye old O'Reilly

**Building my team to fight the forces of evil**

I got in touch with a developer through rent-a-coder called Kumar Bibek who has 3 years experience fighting the forces of evil (developing Android apps). We had a conversation that went something line:  "I can make the bow, can ye make the arrow?"  We agree'd on 100$ for the array (final bits of the work that were out of my skill set).

**Overview of the bits I'm doing:** Making Classdroid look fit for a princess (Layout design/User interfaces) Making Classdroid easy to use  (Application flow) Making Classdroid link together (Intent assignments) Designing how Classdroid will save our princesses minions (Database design)

**Overview of the bits he's doing:** Not shooting the messenger (Code to read/write preferences/settings to/from SQLite[2]) Carrier Pigeon nurturing (Control method for post to Wordpress[3]) Controlling the Eye of  Gondor[4] (Camera SDK[5] modifications)

**In the Sage's library I found a piece of parchment with some notes scribbled on it:** Resource = text,pictures, sound objects, layout.... Intent = change the page View = new page layout/display \n = newline[6] when using text elements

Very cryptic clues, maybe I will need them to enter the great hall of Droidville?

**It's been a long day.....**

As the day drew to a close and the Sun nestled the hills of Azrowilsden I discovered Wordpress have an android application that does 80% of what I want to do from a control point of view so I'm going to hack into that to save me needing to write the function that posts the RPC[7] over XML[8] to Wordpress.  This is why the world should embrace more open source, it empowers us all instead of dumbing us down like iLem users who are too scared to google how to create an android application (or don't see it being a valuable use of their time).

As the iLem users fall off their platform I am gently warmed inside by the knowledge that we are creating a better, more open world without any corporate borders.  One application at a time.
