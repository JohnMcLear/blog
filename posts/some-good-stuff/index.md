Every now and again I write about some good stuff, here is my latest good stuff.

## Whiteboard paint

[![maxresdefault[1]](images/maxresdefault1-550x309.jpg)](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/maxresdefault1.jpg) I use whiteboard paint in my office, [I have written about it before](https://mclear.co.uk/2010/05/25/dry-wipe-erasable-paint-iwb-paint/), it's still really useful. I specifically use Rust-Oleum Dry Erase Whiteboard Paint, you can buy it online or at homebase in the UK.

## Nokia 925 & Huwaei ascend

Putting Android on a 925 would by far make it the best phone on the market. The Huweai ascend is my daily driver, it's a great phone all round.

## Gore-tex jacket

## SDR Kits Spectrum analyzer

[![VNWA3-2[1]](images/VNWA3-21-550x413.jpg)](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VNWA3-21.jpg) Not for everyone.. I use spectrum analyzers to anaylze the frequency of some electronics components I work with, the SDR-Kits one I'm using is way below the price of most on the market but does a great job.

## DT 770 Pros

## Oomlout

Oomlout is technically speaking a warehouse full of electronics and bits for hackers and makers, if this sounds like you, you should visit.

## Digital door lock and key

[![nfc-ring-door-lock[1]](images/nfc-ring-door-lock1-550x366.jpg)](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nfc-ring-door-lock1.jpg) So I'm kinda bias here but really, having the digital door lock and using the NFC Ring to unlock it has been useful, it's not like it's a gimmick any more, it's part of my daily life and I'm safer and less inconvenienced now than I was before, I guess that is the intention of any invention and this one ticks the boxes.
