Yep. You [read that right](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/04/13/cisco.flip.flop.wired/index.html?eref=rss_tech&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_tech+%28RSS%3A+Technology%29).. Cisco have killed the product/brand/company.. Why? Because everyone is using mobile phones to capture video and images.. So what choice do teachers have? How about a nice little app for android phones called [Classdroid](https://mclear.co.uk/sites/classdroid)? It's free and is written specifically for teachers.. G'wan.. Give it a go today, search for classdroid on your phone or install it via the market place.
