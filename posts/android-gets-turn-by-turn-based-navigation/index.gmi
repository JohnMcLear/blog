[1]So, this might initially be a very "educationally focused" post but you have to read between the lines to understand the significance of this (even though it was somewhat inevitable) announcement.

Basically turn-by-turn is that lovely lady who tells you to "turn left in 20 meters".  We all knew it was coming to the UK but companies such as Jarmin & Tomtom have been trying to stop it.  That is because they have made absolute packets of money by selling their app to iPhone[2] fanbois and girls alike.

This may be the final blow android needed to really knock the Apple[3] iPhone OS off it's #1 mantel.  How does this affect education you may be asking?  Simple, a consumer based demand of Android[4] handsets is inevitable now that your phone now replaces your usual Sat Nav[5] product, and lets face it.  Google[6] will do some crazy cool stuff with turn-by-turn based navigation, already boasting an incredibly smart caching[7] system that caches your trip so if you lose Internet connectivity you don't lose your map or location.

As android becomes more popular and more schools grow sto adopt the platform it means less iPhone applications will be developed and more Android developers will pop up.  Is this a good thing?  Surely iPhone apps are better than Android apps?  Yes it is a good thing.  Android promotes open source[8] and a large majority of the applications available in the market place are completely free.

So today's  announcement[9] might not have a direct impact on Android in Education but the knock on effect should be huge and the future certainly looks bright the little green operating system and it's place in the UK market.

As a side note its worth mentioning that most of the popular netbooks/tablets will soon run Android (including devices such as the Asus EEE)
