I wanted to put in applications that I think are great for teachers now and will be great in the future. Just to emphasize that point, the list is focused at tools for teachers not pupils. This list is more of a "Top 10 tools for empowering teachers to provide learning".

All are cloud/web applications and I think that says something!

What do you think?

Arghhh, I published this then I realised I missed out [Primary School Safe Search](http://PrimarySchoolict.com), I take this tool for granted but it is awesome.
