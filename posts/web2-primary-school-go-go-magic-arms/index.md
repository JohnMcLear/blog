Due to the success of the [etherpad](http://primarypad.com) on schools web2 services I decided to create a searchable engine. It's very easy to use, [check it out here.](http://primaryschoolict.com/web2.php)

  

[Schools Web2 collection (or something)](http://primaryschoolict.com/web2.php)

It's nothing fancy, don't expect much other than a simple way to find the right service for you. If it's wrong then let me know. If you want to be able to search by subject, year etc. then [please get in touch!!](http://www.mclear.co.uk/contact)
