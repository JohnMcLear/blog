Quite like this other than the logging in part, especially if it logs you into google services, IE gmail. Thought it was worth re-sharing with everyone!  
  
Also worth pointing out [Safe Search](http://primaryschoolict.com) is a good site if you are looking to find a good, safe search engine to use with kids.
