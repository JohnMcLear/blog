I am in the process of feeding primary blogger to twitter. I wanted all new posts posted to primary blogger to the twitter account.

This will allow people to follow @PrimaryBlogger on twitter and get a good idea of what Primary Schools are blogging about.

There is already a Blog roll available on http://primaryblogger.co.uk[1] but this is not available through twitter or any other aggregation service.

I will be using this plugin: http://1uthavi.adadaa.com/ada-wpmu-sitewide-feed-plugin/[2]

This only took 5 mintues or so and is available to see here - http://primaryblogger.co.uk/full-feed/posts[3]

Enjoy :)
