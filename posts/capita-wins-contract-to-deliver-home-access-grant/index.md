Capita won the Becta contract to manage grant administration for the Home Access Programme, which provides computers and connectivity to low-income families Capita have £15.7 million to play with from 16th October 2009 to June 2011.

Some quick initial thoughts: Connectivity will obviously be provided by [BT](http://www.bt.com "BT Group"), estimated £20 per month for internet connectivity over 22 months is £440. Lets say capita take 10% as operation/admin/profit overheads. That leaves us with £14.3 million. Let's estimate that 50% of the people who will require connectivity will also require a computer @ £300 (including support/licensing etc.). So that's £440 on internet, £150 on a computer meaning they can allocate about £600 per person.

Quick initial maths estimates that 23,833 families could be impacted by this across the UK over the next 22 months.

Population of the UK is close to 61 million (source: CIA). This contract may impact 0.3% of the population. Is that enough?
