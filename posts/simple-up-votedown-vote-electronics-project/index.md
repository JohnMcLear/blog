[This simple electronics project](http://www.sunreign.com/info/LedrepairFacebookCommunicator) is a great idea for something kids could make in year 6 or so..  Or at least I think so!

It wont cost that much and I recon if you asked me nicely I could get the boards cut.

Thanks to [Hack a day](http://hackaday.com/) for the nod!
