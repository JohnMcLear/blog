I'm done developing new websites to support 800x600 screen resolution.  I only see one problem and that is a lot of the UMPC's / pebble / small form factor laptops / EEE type devices are coming with a low rez..  Without literally hiding objects on a browser window I just can't make good looking, feature rich sites that work with 8x6..
