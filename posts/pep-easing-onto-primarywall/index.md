I just enabled [Pep easing](http://pep.briangonzalez.org/) on the [open source version of PrimaryWall](https://github.com/Pita/primarywall). Easing is basically where the notes decellerate into place, making them have a much smoother move across the screen.

Using [pep](http://pep.briangonzalez.org/) meant I can remove jquery UI which is a really overweight framework to include so hopefully page load will be faster too :) Over the next few months I will be optimizing page load and including more bug monitoring and hopefully [updating the PrimaryWall.com version.](http://primarywall.com)

Enjoy :)
