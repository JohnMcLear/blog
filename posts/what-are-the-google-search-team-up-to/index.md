As part of my job I get hundreds of sites indexed by the Google search spider on a monthly basis.  The process is simple:  
  
a) Add site to webmaster tools  
b) Verify site  
c) Create Sitemap  
d) Register Sitemap  
  
It has worked loads of times but for some reason this time it hasn't.  I'm trying to get [Yorkshire Training Academy](http://yorkshiretrainingacademy.co.uk/) to be indexed.  The sitemap is showing up fine and has been "read" by Google but the content of the site hasn't.  All URLS match up and no errors reported.  Spooky things going on!
