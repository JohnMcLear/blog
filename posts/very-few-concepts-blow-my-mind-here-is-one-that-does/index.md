This is purely a concept but I love it. The projectors will kill the battery life but I could live with that assuming it has wireless charging. Just the concept of getting rid of a laptop/tablet so my only mobile device is my mobile is enough for me. I would be happy to tap on my leg as an pseudo keyboard. I'm a drummer, I do it anyway.
