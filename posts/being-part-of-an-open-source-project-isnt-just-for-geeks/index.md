Since 2009 I have been working on an open source project, the project is called Etherpad and it's goal is to provide an open collaborative document editing platform. When I first "joined up" I thought I could just help by fixing bugs and writing guides about how to deploy the software but this role quickly evolved.

I found myself taking on various roles and I thought I should share how diverse open-source projects are and the skills required in the hope to encourage more people to get involved even if your background isn't in programming or software development.

## Community and awareness

Maintain the project website Organize community events Watch out for etherpad mentions on social networks and via web based alerts(Such as Google alerts) Promote community awareness via social networks, video sharing websites. Engage with new developers to encourage them to join the cause Provide accomodation for community events Create explanitory and tutorial videos Establish relationships with competing projects Ensure the project can recieve donations

## Development

Provide anonymous usage statistics about software usage Provide a framework for development focused discussions Decide on the project goals and mission statement Develop the project, programming and graphics design Review code submissions Test new code

## Compliance

Ensure legal compliance Organize conservancy membership
