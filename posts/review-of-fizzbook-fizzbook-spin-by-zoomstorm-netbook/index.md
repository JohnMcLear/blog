The Fizzbook is designed for schools, so we're going to check it out then throw it into a few schools and see what the kids think. First things first though, we need to check the hardware and software to make sure its ready to be abused in a classroom!

**Hardware**

  

The touch screen is difficult to use with a finger, it requires a sharp point, I'm usually too lazy to get the stylus out but I do prefer a touch screen over a mouse pad.

  

As you can see in this video, the stylus / writing recognition doesn't work well enough..

  
  

  

  

I did a skype test and the camera and audio quality was fine but the screen decided to develop a bug and wouldn't "Flip" the screen to its foreign alignment.. See video:

  
  
  
  

Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor passed all 4 system requirements so this device should be Windows 7 ready however I'm not sure that the placement of the OEM sticker (hidden under the battery on the inside of the device) is the smartest idea ever. Especially if you begin an install without mains connected.....

  

The speakers are crisp and clear and it has a separate input for a mic and output for external speakers/headphones.

  

Battery life is 4.5 hours which is less than a EEE (Sorry if I keep comparing!).

  

The keys are usual netbook size, no big surprised there, they are tricky for adults to use but I think the kids should get on great..

  

The wireless on the device picks up points fine and connection is easy and sensible. One thing however that is important to note is that the device has 802.11 b/g and N support which is great and is incorrectly documented on most sites stating that is only has b/g!

  

The device can be dropped from 50cm although I'm not sure that telling the kids that is a good idea.... The attitude of providing a device that "can" be dropped will only lead to tears later in life when they receive a device they can't be dropped..

  

Finally, there is a rattling noise that comes from the tab on the handle, this tab is a great idea because it means you will know who's or what class this device belongs to!! Genius!

  

**Software / Operating system**

  

I'm guessing no one made the decision to include the Windows Live bar in IE but it's there and it takes up far too many pixels on a very small screen. Removing the Windows Live bar and favourites is a must just so you can see the actual content you want to see!

  

Bullguard is installed by default and proves to be a real pain in the wazoobi.. Uninstalling this will make your life easier and your experience happier.

  

I did a skype video call test and the audio and video quality were average to good, the camera seems to rotate sturdily on its pivot points which is always nice when small fingers are about!

  

The start up time to desktop was 90 seconds, 15 of these seconds just gave me a black screen before the BIOS logo even popped up.

  

Below is video of me using it on the net, accessing flash games and beginning an internet session as a pupil would.

  
  
  
  
Now its time for kids to tell me what they think!
