Primary School TV[1] has just opened up for public beta. I have been involved in the project for several months now. The cool thing about Primary School TV[2] is how it filters content, I did a short talk about this and uploaded it to youtube.

PrimaryT[3] is letting me release the UI and some of the aggregation technology as open source, so keep an eye on github. It should prove as a useful template / boiler plate for people wanting to make their own tv / video site.

Removing barriers of accessing video content whilst keeping a child in a safe environment was the main challenge. Thankfully (after rigorous testing) we think we have overcome those challenges and the initial testing has been positive.

I hope you get some time to check it out and let me know what you think/how it performs.
