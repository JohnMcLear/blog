A few days ago Matt Lovegrove [mentioned he didn’t have any simple pictogram (aka pictogramme / pictograph) software for his network](https://mclear.co.uk/2011/09/25/ict-teaching-and-learning-framework/) so we went about making him something up!

We decided to make a [simple, free, online pictogram creator](http://primaryschoolict.com/pictograph). This gives you the freedom to use the tool however you see fit!

Key Features:

- Images automatically load
- Up to 5000 items/rows
- We still have no ideas if this is supposed to be called a pictogramme, pictogrammen, pictogram or pictograph creator..
- No need to download/install any software
- Completely free
- Super awesome.
- Open source
