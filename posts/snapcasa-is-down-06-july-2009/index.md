Appears that snapcasa is having some hosting issues, this is affecting some other hosted services that rely on snapcasa.  
  
We can't shed any more light on this right now but if we find out anything we will update this thread.

  

\*Update on 07th July - Snapcasa is back up :)

  

\*Update on 15th July - More reports of unavailable from various sources and its down for me today

  

\*Update on the 17th July - Server has really taken a turn for the worst and is now showing Runtime Error... Down for many hours. I will begin compiling a list of alternatives to Snapcasa for the public however I have started writing my own thumbnailer to provide [http://primarygamesarena.com](http://primarygamesarena.com/)

  

\*Update 18th of November - I have published a post on how to create your own snapcasa alternative.
