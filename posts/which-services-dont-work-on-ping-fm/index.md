Ping.fm is a tool used to post updates to various social networks from one dashboard.

Just had to setup a ping.fm account and realized quite a lot of sites are broken.

Friendfeed (sign up requires twitter/fb) Identi.ca (Breaks your session) Ning (no longer free) Bebo (Breaks your session) Wordpress.com (Didn't work for me) Delicious (Doesn't work) Youare (No longer a service) Tagged (Doesn't work)
