I'm back online after taking a month off to get things done in the real world. Analogue august is great for reviewing where I'm at and getting things lots of things done. I find my focus shifts back to what really matters and the lack of distraction of technology means all the small things I usually forget about actually get done.

In 4 weeks time I will finish my work for Primary Technology then I'm going on hiatus for some time which will hopefully give me some room to work on my other projects. This co-insides with my 30th birthday so it should be a pretty special/exciting time for everyone involved.

The team at Primary Technology have been running the whole show now since October 2011 so I'm confident that my absence wont cause any disruptions and should still leave them as the best company for Primary School ICT services.

I know a lot of people have been waiting on responses/emails from me and I can only apologize for my absence and hope to get back to you ASAP :)

**Consider taking a month off from technology, you might find a life you didn't know you had :)**
