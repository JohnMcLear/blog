The Etherpad community has done a great job lately and we wanted to reward back some of the great work by opening another GunIO bid for another Etherpad Lite feature.  [This time we’re rewarding 60$ to anyone who can add table support to Etherpad Lite!  Have fun and Get hacking!](http://gun.io/contracts/8/ "Etherpad Lite Table support")
