Have you tried to use Yahoo Pipes with twitter lately and had problems?

I am trying to get a search feed into pipes so I can work with it but I keep getting:

> warning error fetching http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=example (420 Unknown)

I am assuming this is due to Yahoo Pipes sending too many requests to twitter?

Does anyone know a good work around for this?

Is the work around to stop using yahoo pipes?
