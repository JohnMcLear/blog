I'm passionate about creating ICT services that can be used worldwide by anyone at any time. I work with a large team of devoted professionals to try to accomplish this.

I was born and raised in Bradford, UK. My schooling began at Heaton St Barnabas and proceeded to Dixons CTC. After discovering at an early age that I wanted to work with ICT I studied various programming languages and began working as a Technical support provider when I was 18. I now contribute to various open source projects as well as running two school ICT service provider companies.

My role in different organizations has been interesting and challenging. I have had the opportunity to manage large teams of some extremely skilled people so far and have enjoyed each challenge thoroughly, no matter how frustrating!
