[1]Did you know when you take a picture on your mobile phone it may add **your current location** to the Exif data[2] of the image?

So if you are out on a school trip and have GPS or location enabled on your device then you upload an image to an e-portfolio or blog **anyone** will be able to see the latitude and longitude of **where you took the picture.**

I discovered this when working on Classdroid and Kudos to Hak5[3] for the useful link[4].  Safe to say all images uploaded from Classdroid will set the location as: "The moon".

This is especially a concern if you out doing school trips and updating your blog on the fly.

**How to turn off location tagging.** On Android, Click Settings then Locations then un-tick My Location.
