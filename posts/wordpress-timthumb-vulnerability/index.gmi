I don't usually blog about vulnerabilities but Timthumb is being exploited all over the place. First off, **don't panic**. Your site is probably vulnerable but fixing it is easy. Simply download the **timthumb scanner plugin[1]**, upload it and then scan your site. Once completed it will patch your site for you and you can get back to work :)
