We have recently partnered with SauceLabs[1] to provide a testing framework for Etherpad Lite. This framework currently supports browser only tests and must be run in Selenium or on the Sauce Labs onDemand service.

If you require a key please get in touch and we will provide you one.

Here is a video that explains How to get started running and writing tests.

**I want to encourage everyone to start forking, writing tests and issuing pull requests to the feature/selenium branch**[2]

Have fun and live strong beef rangers.
