Someone asked me to design a way you could use a mobile device w/ QR codes to vote w/ out too much teacher headache so I did this abstract wireframe/brain dump:

**[QR Vote](http://www.slideshare.net/johnyma22/qr-vote "QR Vote")**

It's a throw away abstract that may or may not get made, it would be interesting to hear if you think it would be useful or not.
