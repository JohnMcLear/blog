Here is the Classdroid[2] apk for public beta. We only have support for primaryblogger and xparena(not a live service) available right now. We are waiting on Moodle V2 to bring moodle support in.

1. Get the Classdroid.apk[3] 2. Read this guide for how to install an .apk[4] 3. Make sure you have a Primaryblogger[5] account & Blog 4. Have fun :)

Note:  We still have a lot of GUI tweeking to do but most of the functionality now exists. We will be releasing the source code once beta testing is complete.

Thanks to this guy[6] for the great custom artwork/logo/icon!
