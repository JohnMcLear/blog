If you ever travel with laser cut wood through airport security you may set off some alarms.

Sometimes after wood is laser cut the dark edges are treated with hydrogen peroxide, a common material used in making explosives. If the security guy swabs your wood (giggidi) then runs it through the particulate inspector it will set off alarms and the sturn woman with a clipboard will ask you lots of questions. No doubt you are smart enough to search for "Laser cut wood", "explosives", "screening", "security" and hopefully you landed up here and now you can tell them what they detected and why they detected it.... GOOD JOB YOU!

I thought this was worth sharing as I set off a few alarms taking my NFC Ring test tool through airport security at MAN.
