So a new LMS came out, this time it's open source and they mean business..

So I did an install guide: 

Then I did a quick getting to know video: 

What I like:

- The fact the developers are all on IRC and easily reachable.
- That the project is open source
- It's relatively slick

What I don't like:

- The sales/marketing video is a bit overly hyped and is going from one LMS to another really change?
- The name.. Really? Canvas!?! Do they realize how hard that is going to be to SEO?
- The docs only cover ubuntu/debian :(
- There is no apt package for the entire lot (I'm lazy)
- It's super CPU heavy
- There are some bugs from the get go.
