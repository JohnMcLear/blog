Does anyone know if its possible to drag and drop in flash on android.  I want to play a flash game on my phone and it appears that the click and drag functionality doesn't exist or isn't supported?  
  
Am I missing something?  
  
The HTC Hero comes shipped with Flash Lite, sound and video works although some games are a bit too heavy for the graphics processor to handle.
