I'm confused... A load of secondary's in Bradford weren't able to get their BSF money to get a new build yet a [new free school has been announced](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11197827).

**Does anyone know what it's intake will be or who is behind the proposal?**

UPDATE: Intake will be Yr7+ and it is funded by Alan Lewis.

UPDATE: It will be built on Northside Road in Lidget Green and will be a 2.1 mile drive from the nearest secondary school (Grange City Technology College).

UPDATE:  The school now has a [website](http://www.kingssa.org) up that answers most of my questions.

There are many likely problems with the location/model and with the council taking education back from Serco I expect to see several sparks flying :)
