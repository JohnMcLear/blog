1) This software is so badly written

2) It fails w/ UAC on in Vista

3) WTF does a teacher have Vista on a laptop for after COUNTLESS becta guidance.

  

My exact error is a frmCatalogue.cmdSave\_Click which is a procedure in Junior Library so I google it. Nothing, no documentation online.

  

So I google ""Junior Librarian" vista" to see if Junior Librarian works on Vista or not. Nothing, no mention.

  

Sucks, they need to document more and spend less time/money on sales.

  

Can't believe im doing this at 00:20am for a teacher who needs it the next day.. . I would twitter bout it but everyone is too busy twittering about a talented Gary Glitter.

  

The internet is starting to fail, we need to get a grip of it..

  

Yea awesome, in remove software its listed as Junior3, way to understand how to insert spaces into the name of an application you tools. Just for the record, next time use ""'s..

  

I'd spend some time blogging all the flaws in this software but I don't think I have enough hours in the day..

  

Okay - Disable UAC/Uninstall/Reinstall JL software and reboot of machine fixed it. Rant over. Someone PLEASE make a decent open source/free online version of this.

  

PS This application cost the school over £1000, tax payers money well spent? You decide.
