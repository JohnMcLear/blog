Turns out that the playstation 3 doesn't like facebook, also turns out that the playstation 3 has strange javascript controls and displays pages in a weird fashion (weird css support).

I love the option of browsing the internet on a playstation but it has to work correct.

News on when the playstation 3 will support facebook connect is sketchy, according to Sony it already does[1].

I have updated the playstation and it still doesn't seem to want to work with the facebook connect function from Primary School Teaching[2]

If anyone can shed any more light on this please leave a comment!
