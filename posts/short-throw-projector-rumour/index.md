I'm not usually one for spreading rumours but I heard today that you can get a Hitachi ultra short throw projector with wall mount fully fit for £949 with a full 3 year bulb + unit warranty.

  

I'm waiting on hearing confirmation but if this is true then it is an amazing deal! I guess we're waiting on an official press release from the [installs team](http://primaryt.co.uk/installs.html)..
