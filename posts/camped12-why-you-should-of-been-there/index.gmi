[1]Just a quick review of CampEd12. It was great, the events were great. It had a great feel. The food and beer was great. The weather was pretty good and the company was fantastic.

My thanks to Helen Daykin, @Dughall, and Bill Lord for organizing such a splendid event and to everyone that attended it.

CampEd all the fun and laughter you need.
