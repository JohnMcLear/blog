This new TTS microphone for classroom use has the usual handy USB port on the bottom and easy record/playback of last clip.  I did find using it a bit fiddly and some of the buttons feel super tacky.  Great choice for KS2!  Not sure on availability/price.  Want to see other options?  Check out my top 5 microphones for classroom use[2].
