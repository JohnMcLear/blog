My Presentation on Primary School Wireless[1] that I did for Bradford Curriculum ICT[2] is due soon. I dropped the hard disk off at Challenge CLC[3] and I'm just waiting on getting the video footage back. It should only take me a few days to process the footage then I will release it on here/youtube.

If you have any questions before it goes live on the site then please email me or Dally@Primaryt.co.uk and we will be happy to help.

Here are our contact details for wireless networks[4]

Just been told the video is now on the hard disk so I will be picking it up tomorrow afternoon!

UPDATE: This is now available on You tube[5]
