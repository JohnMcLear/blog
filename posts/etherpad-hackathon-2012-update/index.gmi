So we’re half way through our hackathon and we have some updates..

We have decided to drop the Etherpad Legacy nameand allow Etherpad Lite adopt the name of Etherpad, we are still working on getting the same features into Lite that were in Legacy so until then this is just an agreement.
The plugin framework is now in very early alpha and developer docs are due today.[4]
A number of bugs have been squashed[5]
We have decided on a prefix for the plugin structure ep_
A number of plugins have been written and will be available to review soon
We now have some example users that we are using for internal discussions.[6]

We’re looking for a nodejs community liaison master, can you help?[7]
We’re looking for a bugmaster, can you help?[8]
We’re looking for someone to lead our continuous testing efforts, can you help?[9]
We’re looking for someone with bugzilla experience and resources, can you help?[10]
