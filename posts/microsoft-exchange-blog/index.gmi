A few years back I stopped most of my work on our pretty nice Microsoft Exchange service and handled over full control the extremely competant Mark at Primary Technology[2].  Mark has many years experience working on our Microsoft Exchange for schools service[3] and I have to say his recent blogging on Exchange 2007 to 2010 migration is fantastic[4].  If you have a minute and you're into Microsoft Exchange stuff then check out Marks fantastic blog[5]!

Also keep your eye on things changing at School Email, we're introducing the new interface and a bunch of other amazing new feature that we are sure schools are going to absolutely love!
