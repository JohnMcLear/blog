](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/opera-mini-logo1.jpg[1]) I decided to test Opera mini 5 beta today on my android phone and although it claims to support designMode I couldn't get many sites that use the feature working, Etherpad, as an example does not work and no output/error is displayed by the browser.
