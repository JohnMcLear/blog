To compete with [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com "Google Docs"), [Microsoft Office](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx "Microsoft Office") 2010 web apps is free. If you want to use Microsoft [Office](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx "Microsoft Office") without an internet connection you will need to purchase the offline version of the [software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software "Computer software") for the usual educational price tag of around £30.

**Microsoft Office Web Apps is an on-line version of Microsoft office.**

So what do you/don't you get with Office web apps?

3. Access anywhere, any time (requires internet)
4. You can upload your current existing Office 2003/2007 documents
