You can now chat with [PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com) using speech input (only supported in Google Chrome). This new feature allows you to talk into the chat dialogue saving those important finger muscles to do furious desk tapping and head scratching.

Try it out and let us know ![:P](http://blog.primaryt.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)
