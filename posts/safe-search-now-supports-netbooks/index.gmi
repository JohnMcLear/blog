Today when I was at Wilsden Primary school I witnessed a child opening safe search[1] on a toshiba netbook and I was ashamed how bad it looked. This was because the netbook was at 800x600 resolution.

Now when you browse to safe search[2] it auto detects your resolution and gives you the appropriate content meaning that netbook users can now enjoy safe search[3] in all its glory :) huraa.
