A few years back I stopped most of my work on our pretty nice Microsoft Exchange service and handled over full control the extremely competant Mark at [Primary Technology](http://primaryt.co.uk).  Mark has many years experience working on our [Microsoft Exchange for schools service](http://schoolemail.co.uk) and I have to say his recent blogging on [Exchange 2007 to 2010 migration is fantastic](http://blog.markftw.com/category/exchange-server/).  If you have a minute and you're into Microsoft Exchange stuff then check out [Marks fantastic blog](http://blog.markftw.com/)!

Also keep your eye on things changing at School Email, we're introducing the new interface and a bunch of other amazing new feature that we are sure schools are going to absolutely love!
