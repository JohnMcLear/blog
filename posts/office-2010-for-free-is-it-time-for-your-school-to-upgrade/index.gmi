To compete with Google Docs[1], Microsoft Office[2] 2010 web apps is free. If you want to use Microsoft Office[3] without an internet connection you will need to purchase the offline version of the software[4] for the usual educational price tag of around £30.

**Microsoft Office Web Apps is an on-line version of Microsoft office.**

So what do you/don't you get with Office web apps?

1. No Microsoft[5] publisher
2. You get limited web based versions of Word[6], Excel[7], Powerpoint[8] and OneNote[9]
3. Access anywhere, any time (requires internet)
4. You can upload your current existing Office 2003/2007 documents

When it comes to it, you have a few options for working with documents.

1. Purchase the office suite.
2. Use the free online tools by Microsoft - Microsoft Live @ Edu
3. Use the free online tools by Google - Google Apps Education Edition[10]
4. Use open office[11] (Free).
5. Use educationally focused alternatives such as Glogster[12], Scribblar[13], Empressr[14], PrimaryPad[15] - Each of these alternatives is specific to one job, and that job is done well. (Mostly free)
