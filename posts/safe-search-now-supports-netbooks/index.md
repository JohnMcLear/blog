Today when I was at Wilsden Primary school I witnessed a child opening [safe search](http://primaryschoolict.com) on a toshiba netbook and I was ashamed how bad it looked. This was because the netbook was at 800x600 resolution.

  

Now when you browse to [safe search](http://primaryschoolict.com) it auto detects your resolution and gives you the appropriate content meaning that netbook users can now enjoy [safe search](http://primaryschoolict.com) in all its glory :) huraa.
