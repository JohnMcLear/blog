Hopefully one of our suppliers will read this and we will be able to review it and keep it :P  
  

Smaller sizes are available. At current these screens are not suitable for primary education due to their price & lack of being able to bring anything new to the users interface. I struggle to see how graphics designers and video editors will feel about this. Imagine 3d modelling on a none flat surface?

  

Who will win, 3d or curved? My moneys on interactive 3d screens for the workplace and curved for gamers/home. Hrm, curved 3d touch screen.. Drool...
