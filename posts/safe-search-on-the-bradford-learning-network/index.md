Today we rolled out a new feature for Bradford Learning Network(BLN) schools that we hope to roll out to other Broadband providers.

Regional Broadband consortiums such as the BLN purchase curriculum focused resources for their customers. We found that a number of schools were not aware of the resources they had access to so we decided to add a links section to safe search that will be displayed when any computer on the Bradford Learning Network accesses safe search.

The links direct the users to the single sign on link of their specific resource and have the Shibboleth WAYF set.

The links look like this:

You can directly link to [http://primaryschoolict.com/bradford](http://primaryschoolict.com/bradford "Bradford schools BLN portal links") to access it from home.

If you would like similar functionality for your RBC or LA then please get in touch!

Technical note: We automatically detect the location of the visitor IE schools from the Bradford Learning Network just visit http://primaryschoolict.com and get the appropriate links. We do this based on IP address of the visitor
