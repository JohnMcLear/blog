We are organizing a hackathon for **February 24th, 25th, and 26th**. The European meet will be held in **Bradford, UK**, with hosting care of Primary Technology and the Etherpad Foundation. Still looking for people who can host corresponding meetings in the US or elsewhere — please get in touch via the mailing list[1] if you’re interested in hosting/sponsoring an additional meetup at another location. Issues to tackle include documentation, a possible Etherpad Lite 1.1 release, work on real-time services and integration with other platforms, and *YOUR IDEA*.

If you’re interested in joining, tuning in remotely, or starting your own meet-up site, please add your details to this pad[2]!
