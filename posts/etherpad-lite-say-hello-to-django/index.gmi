@Sfyn wrote a great write up about how he used Etherpad Lite with his recent thinkwemust.org project[1] so we wanted to show him some love back by sharing his django etherpad-lite app[2] with the rest of the Etherpad Lite community.

Over the next few weeks we have even more announcement so stay tuned
