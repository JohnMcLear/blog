[PrimaryBlogger](http://primaryblogger.co.uk) has Classdroid Support by default but if your blog isn't with PrimaryBlogger then you have to tick a box in Wordpress:

1. Log into your blog
2. Click settings -> writing
3. Scroll to the bottom and tick XML-RPC

Save your settings and Classdroid should work!
