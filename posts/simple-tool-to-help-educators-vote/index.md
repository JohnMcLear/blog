Worried the [general election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election "General election") might be about leaders and not policies? Not to worry, remove any external influences by simply voting on 26 educational policies. Say which you like then it tells you which parties policies you prefer. The site has no [government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") ties or associations and only takes a minute or so.

## Important or not?  This is the link to the tool.
