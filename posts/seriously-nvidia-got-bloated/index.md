title: "Seriously Nvidia? Got bloated?"

Just came to update my graphics card driver and its a 76.2 mb download.  Can't help but feel nvidia is going the way of winamp or nero..   Talking of nero, how much does it SUCK at burning Divx to DVDs, way easier to get a tool from online to directly do the job.

  

To summarize, nero = bloated + fail

Nvidia = bloated.
