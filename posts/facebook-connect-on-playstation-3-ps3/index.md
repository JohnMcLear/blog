Turns out that the playstation 3 doesn't like facebook, also turns out that the playstation 3 has strange javascript controls and displays pages in a weird fashion (weird css support).

  

I love the option of browsing the internet on a playstation but it has to work correct.

  

News on when the playstation 3 will support facebook connect is sketchy, according to [Sony it already does](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc-to-offer-richer-online-social-experience-to-playstationr3-computer-entertainment-system-owners-with-facebook-integration-70351197.html).

  

I have updated the playstation and it still doesn't seem to want to work with the facebook connect function from [Primary School Teaching](http://primaryschoolteaching.co.uk)

  

If anyone can shed any more light on this please leave a comment!
