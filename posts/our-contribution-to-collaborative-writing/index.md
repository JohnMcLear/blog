Since December 2009 we have been contributing towards an open-source project called Etherpad.  Open source projects can be described as free software that is free to modify, use and redistribute.  [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) has been the technology we have used for [PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com).  Today Etherpad Lite finally reached Version 1 which means it’s ready for download and widely adopted usage.  We’re really proud of this achievement and we hope to support the project into the future.
