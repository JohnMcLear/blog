Due to the success of the etherpad[1] on schools web2 services I decided to create a searchable engine. It's very easy to use, check it out here.[2]

Schools Web2 collection (or something)[3]

It's nothing fancy, don't expect much other than a simple way to find the right service for you. If it's wrong then let me know. If you want to be able to search by subject, year etc. then please get in touch!![4]
