I found some of the options for the [#edchat poll](http://twtpoll.com/oh1hfj) a little confusing so I figured someone else must too.. Please help me try to clarify the options.  
  
Option: Should teachers digitally open their gradebooks to parents?  
Explanation: Teachers and educators assess pupils performance constantly throughout their education, do you think that this information should be constantly available to the parents of the pupil throughout their entire education, some of their education or not at all?  
  
Option: What edtech standards should be included State wide?  
Explanation: Some states are starting to incorporate standards for using technology. However, these standards are not uniform and often filled with difficult jargon. What standards would we include if asked by our schools to come up with standards? What should students be able to do with various technologies- problem solve, collaborate, etc.?  
  
Option: How should administrators and school leaders take an active part in edtech Professional Development?  
Explanation: How should school administrators and leaders be trying to encourage other teachers and leaders to improve on their technology skills  
  
Option: How do you prevent burnout on Social Media?  
Explanation: We become much busier as the school year starts. However, teachers still want to keep up with their Twitter, Ning, LinkedIn, Facebook,and other social media accounts. How do we balance our lesson planning, grading, personal lives, etc. and still keep active with our personal learning network?  
  
Option: What objectives are necessary for effective edtech integration?  
Explanation: What goals are necessary for effective technology integration into education? How can we assess these goals and decide what they should be? Can be it "Graded" or is it a mistake to think a grading system will not get dated quicker than a system is implemented?
