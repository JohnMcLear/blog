All of my webmaster tabs have been broken by googles latest update to the Webmaster Tools set :( Nothing is showing up in igoogle and when i try add new gadgets it just brings through the whole page and not the important parts I need :(  
  
Is everyone else experiencing the same level of fail?  
  
Does anyone know if Google broke the webmaster gadgets?
