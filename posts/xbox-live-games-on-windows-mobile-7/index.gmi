So I don't feel emotional about this, that pretty much sums it up..

I think its cool that Microsoft are trying but I don't believe it's enough.  Shame though because I think a load of educational games tied into an Xbox live type reward structure would be highly motivating and more motivating than a reward structure that is purely focused on Edu[1].

5 main barriers for Microsoft:

1. WM7 has too much catchup to do on android
2. WM7 doesn't have a following of developers
3. WM7 devices wont be as open as android
4. The Xbox live market is pretty small (compared to Google owned farmville etc.)
5. Lots of xbox live games just wont translate well to mobile (control/interface issues etc).

Will I be looking to develop some educational games for xbox live?  Nah.  I'd rather stick with Flash/HTML5 games and a free/open scoring/reward mechanism[2].
