1. I enjoy doing geeky sessions with Tom Hudson[1] discussing the latest programming and fun net stuff and I'm quite looking forward to getting to work on Classdroid with him if he decides to get involved.

2. Moodle[2] doesn't have the API[3] functionality I hoped it would have.

3. Ushahidi[4] has nice API functionality and I should remember to use curl to test POSTing my data.

4. I shouldn't hastily bash out blog posts when I find out a new software threat to privacy or security, I should probably put a 24 hour buffer in or something.

5. The kids **still** make the job worthwhile[5].
