"PrimaryWall is a web-based sticky note tool designed for schools that allows pupils and teachers to work together in real-time" - and it was conceived by Lord [James Langley](http://twitter.com/lordlangley73) to replace the unstable and overly complicated Wallwisher and Linoit in schools.  [PrimaryWall](http://primarywall.com) is initially starting with just public features and in beta so we can get quality feedback from teachers and pupils.  We have tested it in a few Primary Schools and it has been fast, stable and most importantly enjoyable.  James asked me to develop it in January with the idea that it is easily accessable from [PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com) but a lot has happened over the last few months so it took us a while.

To make PrimaryWall we had to work on a lot of new technologies and to learn about these technologies we made a game which is due to be published in a few weeks. The initial plan was to use the standard PHP/AJAX/Apache stack but we figured [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) would be way more fun and make for a much sharper collaborative experience.

We were able to publish [PrimaryWall](http://primarywall.com) [open source](https://github.com/Pita/primarywall) so you can host your own if you want.  We hope to bring professional options in soon so watch this/that space :)

I would love to hear your thoughts about [PrimaryWall](http://primarywall.com) so feel free to leave me a comment or post a message on the [Primary Technology community](http://ask.primaryt.co.uk). Alternatively if you have a blog it would be really useful if you would do a review letting me know your pro's/con's and what you would like to see in the future. Our basic link of functionality we are adding is:

- Password protect walls
- Manage walls - Delete etc.
- Change font
- Change background
- Profanity detection and filtering
- Phone support
- Pass name of author from third party applications
- Easy wall embed
