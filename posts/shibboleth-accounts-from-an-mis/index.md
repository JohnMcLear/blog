Today I'm happy to announce that the project I am working on (Yet to be publicly announced) will allow schools (subscribed and unsubscribed to LA internet packages) to use an independant(Yet approved by Ja.Net) single sign on IDP that will automatically update accounts (cleanly) from the school MIS.

  

The package is extremely easy to install (2 clicks and type in an id, username and password) and you are done.

  

An official press release is due in a few weeks (once most of the development is done and beta testing has begun).

  

Shibboleth is a way that schools can type in their username and password once and access a range of services such as google apps, primary email and other great web services.
