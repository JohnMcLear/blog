[![](images/hp-touchsmart1%5B1%5D.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NislCXjnul0/SwxgVOeTxvI/AAAAAAAACck/mIgwKSBtohg/s1600/hp-touchsmart1%5B1%5D.jpg)[George did an article on Emerging Technologies](http://www.veletsianos.com/2009/11/24/emerging-technologies-in-primary-education/) in Greek and I couldn't read it so I figured I'd do a post then ask George to see how many of technologies overlapped.

  

Here is my list of Emerging Technologies:

- Web 2 Replacement (ie [Google Apps](https://mclear.co.uk/2009/11/24/google-apps-in-a-primary-school-%E2%80%93-getting-started-guide/), [Primary Email](http://primaryemail.co.uk/)) for non web applications
- Single Sign on / Federated Login (Such as the [UK Federation)](http://www.ukfederation.org.uk/)
- SMS, Email & Social networking sites ([Facebook](http://facebook.com/)/[Twitter](http://twitter.com/)) to communicate both with pupils and teachers
- Netbook devices
- Touch screen devices (Such as fizzbook)
- Cloud storage, Files stored online
- More 1:1 projects (One Laptop per Child) and learning at home

**UPDATE:** 4 out of 7 overlapped with George (see comments for more details!)

  

Here are some I missed off 'cause I forgot..:

- Learning while playing games (Such as [Primary Games Arena](http://primarygamesarena.com))
- Oled/eink display boards and learning panels once the technology matures
- Learning outside of the school gates (Continued learning (with/without a structure))
