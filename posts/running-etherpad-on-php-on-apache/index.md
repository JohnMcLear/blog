**Etherpad does not use PHP or Apache.**

Etherpad uses Javascript in NodeJS. You should ask your web host if they support NodeJS and if they have a guide for you to get started deploying NodeJS apps to their hosting.

Here are some services that can provide web/Node hosting for you to test/play with:
