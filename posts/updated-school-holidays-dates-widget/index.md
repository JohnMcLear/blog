We recently updated the [school holiday widget on My School Holidays](http://myschoolholidays.com/api.php?id=8639). To get yours simply visit My School Holidays, find your school and copy/paste the embed code into your blog, learning platform or website.  
  
On top of the visual updates we have put in we are in the process of adding holiday dates for 5 more countries and we have an app in the works!
