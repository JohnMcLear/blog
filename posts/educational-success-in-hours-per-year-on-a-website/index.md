Total hours since Nov 2,2008:  
  
[School Email](http://schoolemail.co.uk/) = 7,806 hours  
[School Safe Search](http://primaryschoolict.com/) = 1,894 hours  
[Primary Games Arena](http://primarygamesarena.com/) = 1,154 hours  
[Primary Technology](http://primaryt.co.uk/) = 771 hours  
[Primary Blogger](http://primaryblogger.co.uk/) = 770 hours  
[Primary School Teaching](http://primaryschoolteaching.co.uk/) (Opened May 2009) = 408 hours  
School Closures (Opened Sep 2009) = 84 hours  
[McLear](http://www.mclear.co.uk/)(My Blog) = 63.7 hours  
  
Thanks to [google analytics](http://google.com/analytics) we can get this information.  
  
I have being able to use this information to explain the real time importance of the sites to their teams. For example if I say to a coder the website has 400 visits a day it doesn't sound as impressive as if I say..  
  
"The website gives 10 hours of educational help every single day..."  

  

[Primary School Teaching](http://primaryschoolteaching.co.uk/) has served 2+ hours worth of resources every day, for a website purely built by a community of educators I think our hats go off to teachers for being part of a sharing, web2 community.

  

Of course if your website is purely designed then a user will struggle to get to the resource they need, we know that isn't the case here - our users tend to come, find one thing then continue to browse around the site looking for useful resources. Are teachers and learners naturally inquisitive?
