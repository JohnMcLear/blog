I will be at Bett on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (Jan 2010). Wednesday will be my day of aimless wandering looking out for new things. Thursday and Friday will be available for meetings, interviews and other general chats. Please let me know if you want to meet me at BETT ASAP so I can schedule slots and please include a suitable time/meeting point or if you want me to arrange somewhere/time.
