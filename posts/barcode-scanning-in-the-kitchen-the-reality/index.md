I wanted to give barcode scanning a chance so I went downstairs and tried the most obvious thing to scan, a bottle of copella juice. It got the product and did it's thing.. Great!

  

So I tried some old paprika in a jar, few years old so fail :(

  

Then I tried some cumin from tesco - no luck with that so I figured maybe there was a problem so I gave it something easy to scan..

  

A carton of eggs bought last week from tesco, surely this staple food will come up as a recognised by froogle? Shockingly it didn't...

  

The room in my house with the most amount of barcodes in and the tool failed me :(

  

At what point will barcode scanning tools recognise the majority of none electrical goods? Who are we waiting for on this? The major supermarkets? Maybe it's just tesco who are really bad at publishing their products on froogle or maybe froogle isn't penetrating enough online food stores to get databases (using base or whatever they chose to use)?
