Sometimes we get email that really make all of the hard work we put in worthwhile. Here is one of those emails:

> Just a note to say thank you for the excellent two packages I have used today. As you are no doubt aware that today was a strike day and unfortunately our school decided to close. Without politics being discussed I decided not to strike and used the Internet and two of your packages to host my lessons – run from the classroom, but with children in their homes. The technology worked seamlessly. My only issue was not having names on primary paint.  The software was quality all over and made my interactive lessons almost as they would be in the classroom. Thanks again.

So not only did we get some positive, quality feedback we also got a bug report ![:)](http://blog.primaryt.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) Thanks to the sender!
