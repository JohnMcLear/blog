I went to McSorley's wedding ring shop in Leeds to get some custom / bespoke ring designs done for a band I was working with and he constantly promised things he never delivered.

Most of the emails he sent were incoherent..

Most of the time he doesn't answer the phone as he isn't even in the store..

It also took 4+ months to get a refund. Even that came in two parts with him thinking it was okay to refund me less than I paid..

Avoid this shop, it will burn you.
