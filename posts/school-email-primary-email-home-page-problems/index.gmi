We received a small volume of complaints today from users experiencing a “white screen” when attempting to access Web Mail.

This problem was due to users trying to access web mail using saves links or short cuts from other websites, to avoid this problem please navigate to http://www.primaryemail.co.uk[1] directly. If you do create short cuts to School Email / Primary Email we advise that you manually add the URL and point it to http://www.primaryemail.co.uk[2]
