[Beautiful Curves](http://tholman.com/experiments/html5/beautiful-curves/) is a really nice web based tool for creating pretty drawings.[![](images/pretty-550x310.png "pretty")](https://mclear.co.uk/2011/11/13/beautiful-curves-web-based-drawing-tool-for-kids/pretty/)

No doubt you will do what I did and either write your name or draw a face!

It wins in the coolness category too as it's built using canvas/JS so it's open source and free to play :)

Nice!
