[Naace's press release on the future of technology](http://www.naace.co.uk/pressrelease/outcomespolicyexchange) is a great read and I thought I'd summarize it for you and provide some links to resources that will enable you to adopt their vision of the future.

Our team at [Primary Technology](http://primaryt.co.uk) are going through each of these points of reference that Naace have indicated and looking at ways we can provide a web based service that will enable teachers to have an easier barrier to uptake an accomplish the goals set out.
