I'm a lover of curry so I write this with a heavy heart, I don't have much time so I'm going to write in bullet points how bad they messed up:  
  
Negative:  
  
Overpriced (Avg £8.50 a dish)  
They got my curry name wrong when delivering it to the table ( A BHUNA IS NOT A FSKING MADRAS - cardinal sin you stupid muppets)  
We took some curry to go and they got them all mixed up  
They stood over our shoulder while we ate  
They made a curry called a Meesah or something which was the worst thing I have ever tasted.  
Too much emphasis on style over substance.  
  
Positive:  
  
Main portions were a good size.  
Starters were good.  
  
In a nutshell, not a place to re-visit.  
  
Also Wt monkey is going on w/ the med theme upstairs, indian vs mes from a place that was once renowned as the best sweet shop in bradford.. FAIL!
