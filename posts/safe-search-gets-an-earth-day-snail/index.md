Today I added a snail banner to the [safe search](http://primaryschoolict.com) page to promote a move towards using ICT as an embedded tool and to move away from the standard wasteful paper based approach of sharing information.

Before I run into a flak of teachers accusing me of a Zionist approach to education I will say that paper has its place and that ICT shouldn't have to be used in every lesson.  I am merely trying to help promote something I believe in.  It will be removed on the 25th when Earth day has finished.  [More information on Earth day](http://earthday.org) and [more information on the pledge to go paperless for the day](http://teachpaperless.com).
