Today Etherdraw hit Version 2, major noticeable difference is that edits are now saved and visible on reload.

Collaborative drawings are now way faster, more reliable and it should be easier for future development.

It's really cool how much my projects are now being maintained by other people and I'm really grateful for their efforts and time. At the same time I'm glad I chose open source :)

Enjoy!

[Have a play](http://draw.etherpad.org/) - remember to invite / join someone else and draw collaboratively, it's a bit boring by yourself :)
