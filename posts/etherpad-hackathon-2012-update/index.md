So we’re half way through our hackathon and we have some updates..

We have decided to drop the Etherpad Legacy nameand allow Etherpad Lite adopt the name of Etherpad, we are still working on getting the same features into Lite that were in Legacy so until then this is just an agreement.  
[The plugin framework is now in very early alpha and developer docs are due today.](https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/wiki/Creating-your-first-Etherpad-plugin/)  
[A number of bugs have been squashed](https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/commits/master)  
We have decided on a prefix for the plugin structure ep\_  
A number of plugins have been written and will be available to review soon  
[We now have some example users that we are using for internal discussions.](http://beta.etherpad.org/p/ourusers)
