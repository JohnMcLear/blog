So Iv'e been making a new interface, so what?

  

Well I really went all out this time, many of you may know the [Primary School Safe Search engine](http://www.primaryt.co.uk/google), it currently recieves bout 4000 hits a day and is used in hundereds of schools..

  

Well check [http://PrimarySchoolICT.com](http://primaryschoolict.com/) out!!

  

I may make it perm, it depends on teacher feed back and general observations.  [Primary School ICT](http://PrimarySchoolICT.com)  is designed it to work on 1024/768+ which is an issue cause some schools still run on 8x6 especially on IWB machines..
