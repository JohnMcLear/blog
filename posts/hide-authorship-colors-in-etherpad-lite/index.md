A few months ago I wrote a new feature into Etherpad Lite but forgot to promote it, subsequently I keep recieving issues and requests for "how to hide authorship colors".  So here it is, it's really easy

Just add:

**?noColors=true** to the end of your Etherpad Lite Pad's URL IE

[http://beta.primarypad.com/p/test?noColors=true](http://beta.primarypad.com/p/test?noColors=true)

The other options including monospace are documented on the [jQuery Etherpad Lite plugin I wrote](https://github.com/johnmclear/etherpad-lite-jquery-plugin)
