When I'm visiting schools lately and talking about the home access scheme and how great it will be I'm always slapped across the face(baby powder included) by one huge, big, stinky question.  
  
I try to encourage schools to allow pupils to bring their laptop in from home, when I ask the school:  

  

**Me: How are you going to support kids bringing their "home access laptop" in?**

  

**Teacher: "What about the kids who don't get a laptop from the scheme?"**  
  
**Me: Erm...??**  
  
Please help me answer the question!  
  
Nearly all of the schools I work with have good enough wireless coverage to support this so it makes sense, right?  We have technical solutions in place for antivirus, updates and other technical risks..
