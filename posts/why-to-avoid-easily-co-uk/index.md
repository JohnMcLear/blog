Firstly they tried to charge me an admin fee after they broke a school website (proved they broke it, no apology recieved) - very poor customer service.

Secondly they just locked me out of the DNS for 50+ school domains because they need more of private information (they have this information).  They never warned me, I can't get in and change DNS.  There is no one answering the phones (as per usual).   Note:  I am not the only person they locked out, they locked out all of their customers until they provide more information to easily.  GG Easily, you have proved once again that epic buckets of fail still exists in the IT industry.

So just avoid Easily, **they suck**.  Never had a good experience with them, never will.  /QuickRant.

Anyone know a good UK registrar I can move all my .co.uk domains to?
