Just a quick set of answers and a copy of the video in response to those who have emailed me asking how I make the videos.

  

All video footage capped in HD.

All audio recorded on a condensor Mic.

Video then dropped into vegas

Audio into cubase

Then move the video/screenshots around in vegas

Export to AVI

Upload to youtube
