[E Ink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink) is a new technology that is exciting investors the world over. E Ink is basically a way of displaying 4 shades of grey onto an LCD type display that uses a less power. I am going to be discussing practical uses for this in a school or classroom environment.

Obvious uses are:

- Replace classroom display boards with relevant material.
- Replace paintings or signs with suitable notices.
- Use as a reading device, alternative to a laptop.

My concept..:

  

It wasn't that many years ago since I left the classroom... Okay, so it was but I still remember most of what I wasn't supposed to be learning. My eyes constantly wandered around the walls looking at the presentation that year 11 had done on osmosis whilst trying not to learn..

  

So I figured..

  

Why not have displays that update with material that is relevant to what the teacher is trying to teach, that way when I start to wander at least I'm learning something that's useful.

  

Something to note:

  

E Ink will mostly be powered by solar and should be sustainable using standard classroom lighting. E Ink will not be a replacement for a computer or laptop. E Ink is a display technology.

  

And to sprinkle the frosties...

  

Currently 7" x 9" screens are classed as "massive". Some of the screens are flexible and most do not have any wireless connectivity.

  

In my ideal world a screen would be 4ft x 3ft, width/height adjustable and include some sort of wireless content delivery system. Oh and it should be solar powered. I want to pay about $200 for this, max.

  

Oh and as my last request I want to be able to roll it up at the end of the term, just so the cleaners don't break it!
