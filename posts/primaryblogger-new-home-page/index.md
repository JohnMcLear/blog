[![](images/thundercats1-300x199.jpg "thundercats[1]")](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/thundercats1.jpg)Iv'e had quite a stressful day so this cheered me up...

I'm working on the PrimaryBlogger new home page to try make things more simple for teachers and whilst recording the audio for the home page video I made this wonderful [sound bite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_bite "Sound bite").

I am quite proud of that one :)

PS the audio is not modified in anyway, that is a natural noise from my voice..
