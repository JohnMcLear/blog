I am in the process of writing an article on how schools can adopt and approach an ownership![](images/trends.gif) model which means parents/pupils contribute towards the cost of the ICT used inside of the school.

  

The principle idea is that the parent/child then owns the device and can be used in the future outside of the school.

  

Various schools have offered to contribute already to this paper but if you know of any school that has adopted this model and wants to talk about the advantages, disadvantages and the learning curve experienced throughout their deployment then please get on touch VIA twitter, email, a comment on this thread or facebook.

  

I am hoping to have this article completed by the end of the summer holidays 2009 and as always I will post for free on my blog.
