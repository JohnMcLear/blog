We were recently made aware of a problem where some Sky Broadband users couldn’t access any of our hosted web services such as [PrimaryBlogger](http://primaryblogger.co.uk), [PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com) and [PrimaryWall](http://primarywall.com). This was due to an incompatible file on our servers which has now been updated, which should have fixed the issue.

We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the users that reported the issue and remind you all that we take any problem seriously and act on them as quickly as we can.

If you discover anything that you think is wrong with any of our services or you’re still having issues accessing any of our services, please report it to us via our support website at [http://support.primaryt.co.uk](http://support.primaryt.co.uk) and we’ll do our best to help rectify the situation for you.

Cheers,

Ed
