I keep forgetting the name of the damn project and I always type it into Google wrong.  Anyway.  Diaspora has momentum.  And it looks like a Ruby project too?

[2]Looks like Ning/Edmodo etc. have their work cut out competing with this open source monster.  Although we have been here before with open source/free social networks.  I feel a touch of de ja vou.  Wasn't there a project called open social or something?  Anyways..  If you care, good for you.  Social networks aren't productivity tools.
