Hi all, just FYI when we updated [Primary Blogger](http://primaryblogger.co.uk) to the latest version of wordpress it broke RSS feeds. We fixed it using [this fix.](http://www.flyaga.info/en/wordpress/plugins/fix-rss-feed-error-wordpress-plugins.htm/)

  

We also added an [FAQ](http://primaryblogger.co.uk/) to the [site](http://primaryblogger.co.uk).  

  

Thanks!
