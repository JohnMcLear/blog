![](images/tumblr_lqnbpfzff11qe0eclo1_r5_500.gif) I don't usually blog about vulnerabilities but Timthumb is being exploited all over the place. First off, **don't panic**. Your site is probably vulnerable but fixing it is easy. Simply download the **[timthumb scanner plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/timthumb-vulnerability-scanner/)**, upload it and then scan your site. Once completed it will patch your site for you and you can get back to work :)
