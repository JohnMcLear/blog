On the 1st of November we implemented a number of upgrades to the Bradford Schools Remote Access system.

What has changed?

1\. Remote Access is now smoother and faster. We are using new technology to ensure a smoother user experience.  
2\. A new Desktop client means that you can access your schools Remote Access from your desktop or start menu without having to go through the web browser.  
3\. Increased security means that you can be confident that only your staff are accessing your schools systems.

What if I have a problem with the new system?
