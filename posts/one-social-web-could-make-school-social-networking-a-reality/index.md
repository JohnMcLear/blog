Ever wished you could have a school [social network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network "Social network") that has the the [privacy settings](http://www.facebook.com/privacy "privacy settings") to protect pupils yet the power to connect pupils and teachers globally?

[One Social Web](http://onesocialweb.org/) may make this a reality.  The purpose of One Social Web is to enable free, open, and decentralized social applications on the web. \*Like Facebook but not owned by Facebook, owned by, well um, everyone!

Usually your school data exists only on your school server.  If your school server was integrated with One Social Web school pupils or teachers could easily be "transfered" to another school without losing any information, files etc. and/or be able to access their old school work whilst being access to connect their new file storage.

The One Social Web platform is based in London, UK and has developers all around the world.  The platform is completely open so anyone can contribute and privacy settings are managed on a per user basis.

It would be interesting to see the first school deployment of this, I certainly hope I will get the opportunity to tie [Primary School Teaching](http://primaryschoolteaching.co.uk) into the platform!  It would also be interesting to debate how One Social Web can work with Shibboleth providing not only single level accessibility but accessibility at an organizational level.
