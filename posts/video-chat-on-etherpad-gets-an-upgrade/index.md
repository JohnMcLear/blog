Today I pushed my new version of the Tokbox plugin for Etherpad.

Tokbox gives you the ability to have video chats on pads. To enable video chat you will have to install the plugin by visiting /admin/plugins on your etherpad deployment and searching for tokbox.

So What's new?

1. More user control such as enable/disable video chat.
2. Site admins to specify their Tokbox key
3. Better support for "Page View"
4. Many UI bugfixes
5. A nice icon for controlling Video Chat

Enjoy!
