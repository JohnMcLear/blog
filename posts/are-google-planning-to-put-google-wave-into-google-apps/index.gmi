[1]Google Apps is becoming more and more popular in schools, mostly due to the Free education edition and ability to use the Shibboleth Authentication mechanism.

On the 29th of September Google Wave released a blog post[2] which highlighted the fact that Google Wave would be available to Universities before the general public.

Google Apps is a profit generating tool for Google so it is in their best interest to include Wave and improve their product. Google Enterprise announced on their blog[3] that they will be bringing Wave to Apps at some point in 2010. An educated guess means that Google Wave will find its way to Google Apps Education Edition in June 2010.
