UPDATE: I won my case. Thanks to [PePiPoo](http://pepipoo.com).

## I will do whatever the internets tells me to do.

[![](images/IMAG0096-2.png "IMAG0096-(2)")](https://mclear.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMAG0096-2.png) Right now I'm suposed to be writing a bid that could bring £100k of new work into the city but because I'm in this pickle I'm not writing it..  This is why [Bradford](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.75,-1.83333333333&spn=0.1,0.1&q=53.75,-1.83333333333 \(Bradford\)&t=h "Bradford") could fail in the future.

You are probably thinking, what pickle?   Well it's all a pickle created by the council, specifically Bradford Council Parking Services.  This is all very petty but it shows just how the petty things in life when mismanaged can have serious consequences.  Anyway, they are basically trying to bully me into a fine that I shouldn't have to pay.

## Here is the story so far

2007 - Jan - I received a £**25 fine** for not properly displaying ticket.

2007 - Feb - I **showed proof** of ticket and fine was cancelled.

2010 - May - I received a **£25 fine** for not properly displaying ticket. (Even though I personally showed the attendant the ticket)

2010 - May - I told them it was in error and **showed proof** of ticket.

2010 - May - Bradford Council Parking Services decided to **still fine me**

2010 - June - I appealed fine and informed council all documents would be released under Apache GPL2 license (for funsies and so they know to protect peoples identities should they choose to)

2010 - June - **Appeal was rejected**.  <-- wtf even with proof that I had paid and displayed!

2010 - June - **Fine was increased to £75**

2010 - July - I tried to re-appeal but was told there is **no way to appeal**

2010 - July - Bradford Council Parking Services threatened me with "**registering debt at court**" and bailiffs.

2010 - July - I threatened Bradford Council Parking Services with equally "registering debt at court".

2010 - September - I appealed as I never received an NTO

2010 - September - I received a new NTO, I now need to through another appeal procedure.

## To summarize

I received 2 parking fines **in error.** I proved they were both in error and now I am threatened with debt being registered at court.

Worth noting the company I own is awaiting about £50k of unpaid PO's from Bradford Council which have been overdue by over a year, should I register them at court too?

## The evidence

The proof I paid and displayed (Note this tickets start time is BEFORE the time/date of the fine so that isn't an issue)
