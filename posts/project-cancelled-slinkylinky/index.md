Today we decided to end our slinkylinky project. Slinkylinky was a URL sharing website that provided a simple, clean interface for sharing URLS. We closed the project due to a lack of interest and because [satpin](http://satpin.com) seems to be more popular.

Over the next few weeks we will be closing other projects that aren’t creating enough steam so if there is a project you like then please share about it via facebook/blog/twitter so we can see that people are using it!
