If you are working with anything that requires and privacy or security it's pretty clear doing this on a publicly facing web service is risky, everyone has been left shaken from Heartbleed.  We will get over this issue but until that point we wanted to remind people you can do local real time document editing sharing and video conferencing so we put up VEtherpad.  VEtherpad is Etherpad with a webrtc plugin installed.  The webrtc plugin introduces Video and Audio chat functionality to pad members.

Think to yourself next time you are using a Google/Microsoft service locally in your organization, do you really want to take the risk of your document/data being leaked?

[VEtherpad](https://v.etherpad.org) empowers you and it's free / open source and easy to deploy.  There is really no reason you wouldn't have a bash!
