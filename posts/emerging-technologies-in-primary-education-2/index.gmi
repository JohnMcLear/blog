[1]George did an article on Emerging Technologies[2] in Greek and I couldn't read it so I figured I'd do a post then ask George to see how many of technologies overlapped.

Here is my list of Emerging Technologies:

* Web 2 Replacement (ie Google Apps[3], Primary Email[4]) for non web applications
* Single Sign on / Federated Login (Such as the UK Federation)[5]
* SMS, Email & Social networking sites (Facebook[6]/Twitter[7]) to communicate both with pupils and teachers
* Netbook devices
* Touch screen devices (Such as fizzbook)
* Cloud storage, Files stored online
* More 1:1 projects (One Laptop per Child) and learning at home

**UPDATE:** 4 out of 7 overlapped with George (see comments for more details!)

Here are some I missed off 'cause I forgot..:

* Learning while playing games (Such as Primary Games Arena[8])
* Oled/eink display boards and learning panels once the technology matures
* Learning outside of the school gates (Continued learning (with/without a structure))
