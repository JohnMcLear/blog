I wanted to explain how [Primary School Safe Search](http://primaryschoolict.com/) is different from Kidrex.

  

1\. Primary School Safe Search does **NOT display adverts.**

  

2\. Primary School Safe Search has a large database of websites it **prioritises as search results** meaning you are more likely to find the correct educational content.

  

3\. Primary School Safe Search has a large database of **websites that are excluded from search results**, these include violent and explicit sites. These sites are not usually filtered with a standard safe search.

  

Both are built on Google CSE.
