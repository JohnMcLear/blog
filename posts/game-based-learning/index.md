It looks like 2010 may be the year of Game Based Learning. With new commercial products such as Manga High hitting the shelves and already established community built sites such as [Primary Games Arena](http://primarygamesarena.com/) it is becoming clear to me that educators are climbing over the mountain of scepticism towards using games to learn and embracing it with open arms.  

I do wonder how sites like Primary Games Arena will embrace the new curriculum. Currently games are themed and have some strategy/game play built around that theme. IE you could have a Viking counting game but you couldn't turn that game from a Viking counting game to a Tudors counting game.  
  

**What are your thoughts on using games to learn?**

  
My thoughts on this is that games could have a new approach, building the logic separate from the theme, allowing users to specify their own style and context but keeping the challenges fun, educational and relevant.

  

**How would you approach this change? Would you begin categorizing games based on a theme?**  
  
I expect I will get the usual response of, "Game based learning has been relevant for years". I don't disagree with this but the momentum and availability behind gaming is certainly increasing.  
  

**Have you been able to find the right game for your lesson?**

My recommendation (because im biased) is to check out:
