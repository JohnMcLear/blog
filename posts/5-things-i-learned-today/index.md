1\. I enjoy doing geeky sessions with [Tom Hudson](http://tomnomnom.com) discussing the latest programming and fun net stuff and I'm quite looking forward to getting to work on Classdroid with him if he decides to get involved.

2\. [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org "Moodle") doesn't have the [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") functionality I hoped it would have.

3\. [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/) has nice API functionality and I should remember to use curl to test POSTing my data.

4\. I shouldn't hastily bash out blog posts when I find out a new software threat to privacy or security, I should probably put a 24 hour buffer in or something.

5. [The kids **still** make the job worthwhile](https://mclear.co.uk/2010/07/08/message-of-the-day/).
