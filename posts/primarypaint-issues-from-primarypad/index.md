We’re currently experiencing an issue with PrimaryPaint. If you click the paintbrush from a PrimaryPad you may have a problem. If you do find you have this problem please visit [PrimaryPaint](http://primarypaint.co.uk) – create a paint wall then copy the URL to your pad and ask your pupils to click that.

We will get the issue resolved as soon as possible. Thanks for understanding ![:)](http://blog.primaryt.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
