[PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com) appears to be the first collaborative word processor to be available for Kindle and it sure packs one hell of a Punch.  [PrimaryPad](http://primarypad.com) is based on [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) so you can do really-real time collaboration over the net.  Currently the user interface is a bit tricky to operate but this will be improved over the next few months.

What does this mean?  If someone calls you and asks you to proof read a letter you can easily do it on your kindle and make any changes in really-real time.

What does it mean for schools?  Could this be the beginning of the demise of school infrastructures including servers/wireless networks.  Could 3G/HSDPA be your device connectivity of the future.

This is the first announcement by the [Etherpad foundation](http://etherpad.org) due over the next 5 days, with another 4 expected it is great news and hopefully a sign of things to come!
