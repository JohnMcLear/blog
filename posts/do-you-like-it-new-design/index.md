How do you like the new design?

  

It took me a few hours to do as I had to modify some images and create 2 new pages (About and Contact). I also had to recreate all of my Gadgets which was a bit of a pain but I had a good backup of all of the code I used so not too bad.

  

Do you think the new blog is clear enough?

  

Do you think it is appropriate for the work I do?

  

Do you think the bar on the left is a bit too long with all those labels in?
