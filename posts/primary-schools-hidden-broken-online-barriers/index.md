Personalised learning needs a smooth transition between various service providers who are  
offering learning content and activities. With continual password prompts being a barrier to this  
style of learning, and putting off many schools. Single Sign On (SSO) should be one of the  
underlying technologies that removes this barrier, yet it is failing to live up to its promise and the  
hard work that many people have put into it. This endangers the whole thrust of personalisation  
mediated by technology.

Schools have both a want and a need to try to personalise students’ online learning. Since 2006  
the majority of schools, districts and local authorities have tried to accomplish this by accessing  
web based learning resources using a Single Sign On system called Shibboleth to avoid  
remembering and having to enter multiple passwords on multiple web applications. At  
Government level this system is called “Federated Access Management (FAM)” but as the scope of  
my report covers a specific mechanism I will not be using this term. This system isn’t achieving its  
goals, in this report I will try to explain why and how we can go about making Single Sign On a  
more natural experience for schools. If I was reading this report I would have given up before now,  
thinking “Meh, its someone else’s problem” but really it isn’t. I hope you can take some time to  
read on and to find out how we can all work together to solve the problem.
