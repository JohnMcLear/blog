 Scirra Construct is an game construction tool that looks like it may be a bit too complex for Primary but if someone could create a wizard interface and some primary school templates and maybe a few LA's start doing some CPD around it the results could be excellent.

I have 2 gripes and they are obvious: It is a download + install application and the games can not be played in a web browser.

If anyone is currently using game maker you should check [this post out on why Construct is better.](http://gamemakerblog.com/2009/01/05/5-reasons-why-construct-is-better-than-game-maker/)

It certainly has the wow factor but with alternatives like 2simple's 2DIY and scratch it may feel like overkill to some!
